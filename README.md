# PipeRewind

**A Time-Travel Debugger for Unix Shell Pipelines**

PipeRewind captures, records, and replays every byte flowing through a Unix shell pipeline. It interposes transparent capture taps between each stage of a pipeline, recording all data with precise timestamps into a binary trace file that supports random-access playback.

## Building

```bash
make          # build the piperewind binary
make test     # run smoke tests
make clean    # remove build artifacts
```

Requires: GCC, Linux (uses epoll, /proc).

## Usage

### Record a pipeline

```bash
./piperewind record "cat access.log | grep ERROR | sort | uniq -c"
```

This runs the pipeline normally (output appears on stdout as usual) while silently capturing all inter-stage data into `trace.prt`.

Options:
- `-o FILE` — set output trace file (default: `trace.prt`)
- `-v` — verbose mode (print capture progress on stderr)

### Inspect a trace

```bash
./piperewind dump trace.prt
```

Prints every recorded event with timestamps, showing what each stage received and produced at each moment.

### Replay (TUI) — coming soon

```bash
./piperewind replay trace.prt
```

Will open an ncurses-based TUI with a timeline scrubber.

                            trace.prt (binary)
                     ┌──────────────────────────┐
                     │ FileHeader                │
                     │ StageHeader × N           │
                     │ Event Event Event ...     │
                     │ IndexEntry × total_events │
                     └──────────────────────────┘
```

For N pipeline stages, PipeRewind creates 2×(N-1) kernel pipes plus 1 for the last stage's stdout. The capture engine sits in the parent process, using epoll to multiplex reads from all stage outputs. When data arrives from stage i, the engine:

1. Records a `DATA_OUT` event for stage i
2. Records a `DATA_IN` event for stage i+1
3. Forwards the bytes to stage i+1's stdin pipe

This is fully transparent — the pipeline produces the same output it would without PipeRewind.

## Trace File Format (.prt)

Binary format with a fixed header, per-stage metadata, a stream of variable-length events, and an index table at the end for random access. See `include/trace.h` for the full specification.

## Course Themes

| Theme | How it's used |
|-------|---------------|
| Process Control | fork/exec to spawn stages, waitpid for lifecycle, ptrace for observation |
| Event-Based Concurrency | epoll event loop multiplexing N pipe file descriptors |
| System-Level I/O | Raw read/write on pipes, dup2 for fd manipulation, non-blocking I/O |
| Process Scheduling | Observing kernel scheduling via /proc, analyzing blocked vs. runnable states |
